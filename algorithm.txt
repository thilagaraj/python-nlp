1.Read the file
2.Lets take one row from file
3.Identify unique label for that row (LABEL_1)
4.Merge columns with spaces and make it as line (LINE_1)
5.Keep LINE_1 and map it to the LABEL_1
6.Remove commas from LINE_1 and map to the LABEL_1
7.Remove special chars from LINE_1 and map to LABEL_1
8.Remove stop words from LINE_1 and map to LABEL_1
9.Now we have around 4-5 lines are mapped to LABEL_1
	DATA = {
		LABEL_1:{
			LINES : ["line1","line2","line3","line4"],
			Tokens: [],
			COUNTRIES: [],
			MATCHES: []
		},
		LABEL_2:{
			LINES : ["line1","line2","line3","line4"],
			Tokens: [],
			COUNTRIES: [],
			MATCHES: []
		}
	}
10.For each lines, Use unigram and run NER to remove named entities, then run pycountry for each words
11.For each lines, Use bigram and run NER to remove named entities, then  run pycountry for each words.. use trigram if needed
12.Now we will get duplicate list of countries.
13. We can rank those cuntries for most match and finalize.
